## Python Calculator

This is a midterm project for IS 601. It is an enhanced calculator application meant to be used through the terminal.

## Features

- Use the terminal to use an REPL-loop based calculator application.
- The calculator accepts single-word phrases, such as an operation or commands to save history, undo, or redo.
- Actively saved data using pandas, and actively logged info / calculation errors using logger.
- Unit / parameterized tests to ensure 100% test coverage, with GitHub action configuration already included.
- More to come!
